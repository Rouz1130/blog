Links for more info on each there provided below.
-Desctructuring: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/Destructuring_assignment
-easier way to create the variable set and get for Ember.set/Ember.get. Instead of having to write out Ember.get or Ember.set over and over again I can use the shorthand set or get instead.


-Arrow Functions: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Functions/Arrow_functions

-shorter syntax and it lexically binds the this value.

-New method definitions

-Dont have to write function word just ()
